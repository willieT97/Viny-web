    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      At Viny, we believe that music thrives in communities, not just algorithms.
      Our mission is to reconnect people with their local music scenes â€”
      to make it easy to discover gigs, jam sessions, and hidden gems in your own town.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether youâ€™re a listener, a musician, or somewhere in between,
      Viny helps you see whatâ€™s happening around you â€” and become part of it.
    </p>

    <p>
