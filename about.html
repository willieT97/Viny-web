    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
       <p>
      At Viny, we believe that music thrives in communities, not just algorithms.
      Our mission is to reconnect people with their local music scenes —
      to make it easy to discover gigs, jam sessions, and hidden gems in your own town.
    </p>

     <p>
      Since the 1990's the music industry has declined steadily. This is caused mainly by streaming and piracy. This decline has affected local music scenes greatly. 
      Global music artists have made up for this by charging extortionate prices for concerts. There is high demand for these concerts as this is the music that is pushed by streaming platforms.
      This cycle has destroyed local music scenes globally, which in turn has destroyed local cultures.
      Viny aims to rebuild local music scenes by connecting fans to bands/musicians. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Whether you’re a listener, a musician, or somewhere in between,
      Viny helps you see what’s happening around you and become part of it.
